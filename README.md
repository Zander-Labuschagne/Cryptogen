# Cryptogen
An application used for the encryption and decryption of messages and files.
Additional cryptosystems will be added in the future.

This project is part of a university assignment and is still in progress and is being maintained with JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.

Cryptogen has different look and feels(can be set in the menu bar) and is designed after various KDE Plasma themes such as the Midna Dark, Midna and Breathe Dark Plasma themes of which the Midna themes are the themes used and designed by KaOS, a very beautiful KDE Linux distribution. The Breathe Dark theme is designed after the KDE Plasma theme designed and used by Manjaro Linux, an ArchLinux based distribution which provides all the nice things of ArchLinux but with less maintenance efforts, easier to use and more user friendly.

How to use:
Unzip one of the compressed files, for Linux systems you can run ``sudo sh install.sh`` or for other systems just run the .jar file. On Linux systems it is sometimes necessary to execute ``sudo chmod +x install.sh`` beforhand. Java Runtime Environment 8 is required, OpenJDK will not suffice. This application only works well on Linux systems currently. It can be executed on other systems but known issues exists on Windows such as the drag and drop of files, so instead copy some files in Windows Explorer and use File -> Paste Files.

The columnar transposition encryption/decryption for files still needs fixing. Linux install script included and .jar file as well for other systems. In my experience files larger than 700MB makes the encryption/decryption unreliable.
